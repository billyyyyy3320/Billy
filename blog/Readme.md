# Hello! I'm Billy Chin

A software engineer in web development and a deeper focus on the frontend aspect. I originate from Taiwan, where I was born and raised.

Currently, I work at Appier, Taiwan's pioneering digital unicorn and one of Fortune's Top 50 Leading AI Companies.

Additionally, I'm a core member of the VuePress team, a static site generator powered by Vue.js, although I have been inactive since 2021.

I've put this blog on hold as I've concentrated on my career and personal life. However, I plan to reactivate it in the near future.
