# Why I like "`git rebase`"

[ÁπÅÈ´î‰∏≠Êñá](/zh/2019/08/15/why-I-like-git-rebase/) | English

Please take a look at [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) if you've never used `git rebase` before.

I'm going to share the reason or timing I use `git rebase` and `git push --force-with-lease`. I feel like there's still many people don't know there's a useful stuff `git push --force-with-lease`. In my opinion, we should always use `git push --force-with-lease` with `git rebase`.

## Why I like `git rebase`

### Commit history is clear and straightforward

Both `merge` and `rebase` can join two branches together, Let's take a look the differenceÔºö

`merge` will put all commits of two branches together and sort them by commit time, It's just like Dragon Ball Fusion:

`rebase` don't care about commit time. It keep every commit which comes from the same branch together. It's like the fusion in One Piece:

See the difference? Even though the fusion is completed, I can still recognize each part üëç.

### The way to solve conflicts

`merge` has to generate a merge commit, maybe it can be [fast-forward](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge), but when there're conflicts, you have to solve it and commit your changes.

On the other hand, `rebase` won't generate any lengthy commit üëç.

`rebase` is actually like rebuilding the base and submit all the commits again. Whenever meeting conflicts, it'll stop to let you solve it. I personally prefer this approach since it's more clear to figure out which changes I want to keep or drop. But it's not really handy when there's a lot of commits and they all meet conflicts.

To be honest, I use them both. Merge commits help me track the merges. I usually use `rebase` to solve conflicts in my feature branch and only use `merge` when I'm going to merge a feature branch to master.

Take a look at difference, only `merge`:

`rebase` + `merge`:

### Feel free to edit commits

It's no longer to do with joining branches together, I've mentioned something like `submit all the commits again`, since it's going to commit again, of course you can edit the commits.

[git rebase -i](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode)

It'll probably show something like below:

# Rebase dc2a5e0..0967d97 onto dc2a5e0 (6 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
```

You're able to reorder, edit commit message, remove commit, or even meld some commits into a previous commit, etc. Well, it's pretty handy,

## `git push --force-with-lease`

### Usage

`rebase` is really useful, but it means you change the history. We don't care about that if the branch is just a local branch. But if you have pushed it to the remote repository, you have to run `git push -f` which is very dangerous.

Thus, I always use `git push --force-with-lease`.

> This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other people did anything to the ref.

If the history isn't what we expected:

```shell
git push origin master --force-with-lease
To github.com:newsbielt703/test-git-push--force-with-lease.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (stale info)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:newsbielt703/test-git-push--force-with-lease.git'
```

### Bad things happened

What if you screw up, maybe you have just run `git push -f` and someone lost his/her work? No worries. I found something interesting - [git-blame-someone-else](https:/github.com/jayphelps/git-blame-someone-else). Install it and run `git blame-someone-else "yourteammate <yourteamate@gmail.com>" <commit>`. See what happen below, it's no longer your fault:
